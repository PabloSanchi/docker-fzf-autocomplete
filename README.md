# Docker + FZF Autocomplete

This script makes Docker commands easier to use with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

It lets you pick containers, images, and commands with a fuzzy search menu in your terminal.

<img src="imgs/fzf-docker.png" />

<b>It simply shows what you need, no more having to remember docker autogenerated container names!!</b>


## What is it for

- Lets you fuzzy search Docker commands
- Shows only running containers when you use docker stop
- Shows only exited containers when you use docker start or docker rm
- Shows all images when you use docker rmi
- Works with logs, exec, cp, and more
- Falls back to normal if fzf or docker is missing

## How to use

Type a docker command type `**` and then press <kbd>TAB</kbd> to pick from a list.

### Examples

```bash
docker stop **<TAB>    # pick from running containers
docker start **<TAB>   # pick from exited containers
docker rm **<TAB>      # pick from exited containers
docker rmi **<TAB>     # pick from images
docker logs **<TAB>    # pick from all containers
docker exec **<TAB>    # pick from running containers
docker cp **<TAB>      # pick from all containers
docker **<TAB>         # pick from all docker commands
```
